    <!--This code is used to design a page to display all the courses I have taken so far, that includes
    level 1 and 2. The purpose is served with the help of a table which contains info about course , title, code and
an image related to the title of course. The page has same header and footer as the other pages except there's an
unfunctional search build with an occupied search placeholder in the header.. The page contains several divs to serve
the purpose of effective css styling. A fieldset is used to use input tags to built a filter list with chekmarks 
and a sort list with a drop down which are non-functional.-->
